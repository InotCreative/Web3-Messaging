## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Framer Motion
- **Smart Contract**: Solidity, Hardhat
- **Storage**: IPFS (Web3.Storage)
- **Blockchain**: Polygon Mumbai Testnet
- **Authentication**: MetaMask

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ and npm
- MetaMask browser extension
- A Web3.Storage account for IPFS storage

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web3-messenger.git
cd web3-messenger
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
# Network Configuration
MUMBAI_URL=https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/v1/your-api-key
PRIVATE_KEY=your-wallet-private-key

# Web3.Storage Configuration
WEB3_STORAGE_TOKEN=your-web3-storage-token

# Optional: Etherscan API Key for contract verification
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your-etherscan-api-key
```

## Smart Contract Deployment

1. Compile the smart contract:
```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

2. Deploy to Mumbai testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network mumbai
```

3. Copy the deployed contract address and update it in your frontend configuration.

## Development

1. Start the local development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## MetaMask Configuration

1. Add Mumbai testnet to MetaMask:
   - Network Name: Mumbai Testnet
   - RPC URL: https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com
   - Chain ID: 80001
   - Currency Symbol: MATIC
   - Block Explorer: https://mumbai.polygonscan.com

2. Get test MATIC from the [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)

## Usage

1. Connect your MetaMask wallet
2. Add contacts using their Ethereum addresses
3. Start messaging with end-to-end encryption
4. Share files, voice messages, and react to messages
5. Edit or delete your messages as needed
6. Block/unblock contacts if necessary

## Security Features

- End-to-end encryption using public-private key pairs
- Messages stored on IPFS with encrypted content
- Smart contract ensures message integrity and authenticity
- Secure file sharing with IPFS content addressing
